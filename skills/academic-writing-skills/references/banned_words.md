# Banned Words, Phrases, And Patterns

Items below should be deleted, replaced, quantified, or justified. Paper-specific
overrides in `.paper/style_overrides.md` take precedence.

This file covers field-agnostic GPT-style vocabulary. For field-foreign
jargon that signals "this author is not from our discipline" to reviewers
(terminology imported from a sub-field, method paper, software repository,
or neighbouring discipline that the target journal's reviewer pool does
not use natively), see `writing_principles.md` §4.6 and the "Domain
Vocabulary Swaps" section of `.paper/style_overrides.md`.

## 2. Banned Phrases

- "It is important to note that..."
- "It is worth noting that..."
- "In recent years..."
- "In today's world..."
- "plays a crucial role"
- "provides a comprehensive framework"
- "as mentioned above"
- "as established earlier"
- "beyond this"
- "in this regard"
- "with respect to this"
- "sheds light on"
- "a testament to"
- "the interplay between"
- "ever-evolving"
- "at the forefront"
- "moving forward"

## 3. Weak Demonstratives

Flag subject-less openings such as:

- "This ensures..."
- "This enables..."
- "This allows..."

Replace "this" with the actual antecedent unless the previous sentence makes it
unmistakable.

## 4. Sentence Starters

Generally avoid:

- "Furthermore,"
- "Moreover,"
- "Additionally,"
- "Building on..."
- "Together,"
- repeated "By [verb]-ing, we..."

Style-dependent starters such as "Although", "Yet", "By contrast", "Therefore",
and "Thus" should follow journal and advisor preferences.

## 5. Structural Patterns

### Long Dash Overuse

Some journals allow long dashes and some advisors dislike them. The universal
rule is overuse: more than two long dashes in one paragraph usually signals
sloppy or AI-like prose. Follow `.paper/style_overrides.md`.

### Adjective Stacks

Avoid noun piles such as "comprehensive robust multi-scale framework". Use one
adjective and a precise phrase.

### Colon Lists Inside Prose

Avoid "Three factors: (a)...". Integrate the list into the sentence or use a
proper list.

### Repetitive Openings

Three consecutive sentences beginning with "The" or "This" should be revised
unless the repetition is deliberate and clear.

### Participial Chains

Avoid paragraph openings such as "Building..., integrating..., and leveraging...".
Use direct claims.

## 6. Overclaim Language

For inferred findings, avoid:

| Avoid | Prefer |
|---|---|
| confirms | is consistent with |
| proves | suggests |
| demonstrates | indicates |
| determines | shapes |
| controls | influences |
| ensures | tends to |
| eliminates | reduces |
| drives | contributes to |
| explains | may explain, is consistent with |

Use "significant" only with statistical evidence.

## 7. Mechanistic Trigger Phrases

These phrases often invite reviewer pushback unless the method explicitly
supports them:

| Trigger phrase | Safer replacement |
|---|---|
| preferentially selected | more likely to |
| systematic bias | average difference of X |
| filter tightens | share changes from A to B |
| removed from the denominator | no longer included in the group |
| residual group | remaining group meeting criterion X |
| isolates the effect | focuses on, conditions on |
| hard-coded | specified in Methods |
| explains away | accounts for X of the gap |
| must, necessarily, invariably | tends to, on average, in N cases |

## 8. Detection Heuristic

For any suspicious sentence, ask:

1. Would a domain-expert PhD student write this?
2. Does removing the sentence lose information?
3. Are there too many adjectives before one noun?
4. Does the sentence use a metaphor where a technical term is needed?
5. Does every demonstrative have a clear antecedent?
